## Reference protein database.
# It is recommended to provide absolute paths, i.e. beginning with root (/).
# Else, paths are considered to be relative to SAMAR top-level directory.

## K-mer size
# A positive integer value is required as input
k-size: 7

## Threshold
# A positive float value is required as input
threshold: 40.0

## RNA-seq reads
# It is recommended to provide absolute paths, i.e. beginning with root (/).
# Else, paths are considered to be relative to SAMAR top-level directory.

## Enable/disable differential expression analysis.
##Possible values: yes or no.
##Defaults to "yes" if unspecified, in which case you must specify the "factors", "sample_info", "design" entries below.
deanalysis : "no"

#Sample information

  sample_1 : [control] #list of names of level of the factors, which the sample corresponds to.
  sample_2 : [control]
  sample_3 : [control]
  sample_4 : [treated]
  sample_5 : [treated]
